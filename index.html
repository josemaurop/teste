      <h2 class="section-title">Why Guacamole?</h2>
      <p>Guacamole is one of the most iconic dishes in Mexican cuisine. It’s naturally healthy, vegan-friendly, and incredibly versatile — perfect with tacos, on toast, or as a dip for veggies and chips.</p>
      <p>Fun fact: The name "guacamole" comes from the Aztec word *ahuacamolli*, meaning "avocado sauce."</p>
